**Hybrid Search Using RAG with Knowledge Graph**


This repository demonstrates a hybrid search approach using the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) model integrated with a Knowledge Graph. The RAG model combines retrieval-based search with generative question-answering by retrieving relevant information from structured knowledge represented as a graph and generating responses using a pre-trained language model.

A Knowledge Graph provides a structured way to represent and retrieve entities, relationships, and context, which makes it ideal for answering complex queries that require deep contextual understanding.

**Overview**

Hybrid Search using RAG and Knowledge Graph enables:

Structured retrieval using a Knowledge Graph, where entities and their relationships are used to provide accurate and contextual information.
Question answering by generating natural language responses based on the retrieved information and context.
Hybrid approach by combining dense retrieval from knowledge graphs with generative models for more comprehensive answers.

**Key Features**

1. Integrates RAG for hybrid search using knowledge graphs.
2. Efficiently retrieves entities and relationships based on queries.
3. Supports handling diverse queries by leveraging both structured knowledge from the graph and generative capabilities of the language model.
4. Applicable for large-scale enterprise knowledge systems and domain-specific search.

**Requirements**

The project requires the following libraries:

* Transformers for the RAG model.
* Networkx or rdflib for Knowledge Graph creation and traversal.
* Graph-tools for handling large-scale graph operations.
* Langchain for retrieval workflows.
* Pytorch for model handling and inference.
* SPARQLWrapper for querying external graph databases.
 Ensure all dependencies are installed using the requirements file.
Make sure your environment is configured with these dependencies.

**Usage**

Knowledge Graph Setup
Set up a Knowledge Graph: You can use any graph database (like Neo4j, RDFLib, etc.) to construct and store your Knowledge Graph. The KG should represent entities, relations, and properties relevant to your domain.

Load data into the Knowledge Graph: Insert your structured data into the KG. For example, using Neo4j:


Cypher code
CREATE (n:Person {name: "Alice", title: "Professor", department: "Computer Science"})
Query the Knowledge Graph: You can run queries on your KG to fetch relevant information:

cypher code
MATCH (n:Person {name: "Alice"}) RETURN n.title, n.department

**How It Works**

1.Knowledge Graph Search: The system first queries the Knowledge Graph for structured information (e.g., relationships between entities, properties of entities) using queries like SPARQL or Cypher (for Neo4j).

2.Dense Retrieval: If relevant information is not found in the KG, RAG uses dense vector search to retrieve unstructured information from document embeddings stored in a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS).

3.Answer Generation: RAG synthesizes the information retrieved from both the Knowledge Graph and unstructured sources, producing a coherent answer that merges the structured and unstructured knowledge.

**Configuration**

Before running the project, you should configure the following:

1.Graph Database URI: In the config.json or script, specify the URI and credentials for your Knowledge Graph (e.g., Neo4j, SPARQL endpoint).

2.RAG Model Parameters: Configure the RAG model name and embedding model
